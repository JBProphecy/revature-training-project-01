## **Spring Initializer Purpose**

---

You can create a `Spring Boot` project with the `Spring Initializer`.

You can access the `Spring Initializer` through the following link.

https://start.spring.io/

This guide reflects my configuration for when I used `Spring Initializer` on `01/29/2026` to create a `Java + Maven + Spring Boot` project.

---

## **Spring Initializer Settings**

There are a few settings to configure for your project.

---

These are the settings I configured for my `Java + Maven + Spring Boot` project on `01/29/2026`.

---

**`Project`**
- `Maven`

---

**`Language`**
- `Java`

---

**`Spring Boot`**
- `4.0.2` (the latest stable version)

**`Project Metadata`**

You most likely only need to change `Artifact` and `Description`. 

When you change `Group`
- `Package name` will be updated to reflect that change automatically.

When you change `Artifact`:
- both `Name` and `Package name` will be updated to reflect that change automatically.

**`Packaging`**
- `Jar` (my requirements)

**`Configuration`**
- `YAML` (my preference)

---

**`Java`**
- `25` (the latest stable version)
