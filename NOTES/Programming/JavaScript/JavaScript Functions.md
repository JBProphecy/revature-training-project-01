A function in JavaScript can be defined with the **function** keyword.

For example...

---

$$ \text{function greeting(name) \{return "Hello" + " " + name\}} $$

---

There are some key parts of a function.
- You have the **function** keyword.
- You have the function name.
- You have the function parameters.
- You have the function arguments.

The **function** keyword signals the declaration of a function.

In the line above, "greeting" would be the name of the function.

In the line above, "name" would be a parameter of the function.

When calling a function, the values entered as the parameters of the function are called the arguments of the function.
