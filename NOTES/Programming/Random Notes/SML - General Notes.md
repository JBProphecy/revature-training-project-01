# Description

Standard ML (SML) is a functional programming language known for its strong type system, type inference, and pattern matching. Here's an overview of the basics, including data types, variable declaration, and some other key concepts related to SML/NJ (Standard ML of New Jersey).

SML is statically typed, which means types are checked at compile time.
