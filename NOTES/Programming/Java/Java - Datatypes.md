# Overview

There are two varieties of datatypes in Java: primitive datatypes and reference datatypes.

The memory location of a primitive value contains the value.

The memory location of a reference value contains a memory address, which references the memory location where the value is stored.

# Primitive Types

There are 8 primitive datatypes in Java.

| Primitive Type | Size    | Stores            |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| boolean        | 1 bit   | a boolean value   |
| byte           | 1 byte  | an integral value |
| char           | 2 bytes | a character       |
| short          | 2 bytes | an integral value |
| int            | 4 bytes | an integral value |
| float          | 4 bytes | a decimal value   |
| long           | 8 bytes | an integral value |
| double         | 8 bytes | a decimal value   |
