# Inversion of Control (IoC)

**`Inversion of Control (IoC)`** is a design principle that shifts the control of object creation and management from the application to a container or framework.

# Spring's IoC Container

Spring has an IoC container that takes care of creating and managing objects for each layer.

The IoC container automatically injects dependencies into the appropriate components, which enables decoupling and loose coupling between the layers.

The benefits of this approach include simpler testing, maintenance, and scalability.
