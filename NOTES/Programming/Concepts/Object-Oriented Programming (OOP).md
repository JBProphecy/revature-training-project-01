# Description

Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that structures code in the form of objects (instances of classes), which are self-contained units of code that typically contains some data and some methods to operate with that data.

The key concepts of object-oriented programming are objects, classes, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. When you're working with an object-oriented programming language, such as Java, you should adhere to the SOLID design principles.

# SOLID Design Principles

[[SOLID Design Principles]]

---

# Inheritance

Inheritance is the classes inheriting state and behavior from another class.

---

# Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the idea of something taking many forms.

Some examples of polymorphism include method overloading and method overriding.

---

# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the principle of containing related state and behavior in a class.

Instance fields for a class should be private.

There should be necessary getters (accessor methods) and setters (mutator methods).

---

# Abstraction

Abstraction is the idea of providing a way to interact with something while hiding or abstracting away the details of implementation.

A car can be an example of abstraction... you can operate a car without knowing how it works internally, as long as you know how to use the pedals, steering wheel, and other essentials.
