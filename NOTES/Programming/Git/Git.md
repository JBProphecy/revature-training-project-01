# Git Bash - Stuck in the Terminal? - Press `Q`

When my server is running in VS Code, I can't type anything and I have to use `Ctrl + C` to close it and be able to start typing again. In Git Bash, I've been stuck in a similar situation where something is happening and I can't type anything... `Q` is my friend.
